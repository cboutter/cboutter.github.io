	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a german agilist, doing Java and dreaming about Ruby. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/story/15108">Read more about me on my Stackoverflow story...</a></p>
	<p>Why this site you're asking? Mainly because I wanted to have a place to host some older blog posts I did, which I don't want to simply disappear because a company takes down their blog.</p>
